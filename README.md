## Hi there 👋

👋 Hello and welcome! I'm a front-end developer exploring how to build fast, modern websites by integrating headless CMS platforms with static site generators. This repository is a reflection of that journey—where I experiment with combining content flexibility with performance-focused development.

My current focus is on bridging the gap between content management and front-end architecture. By using headless CMS tools like Contentful, Sanity, or Strapi, I’m learning how to create content-driven sites that are both dynamic and developer-friendly. On the front-end, I work with static site generators like Next.js, Gatsby, or Astro to deliver blazing-fast experiences optimized for SEO and scalability.

This repo includes examples of how I structure content models, fetch and render data, handle dynamic routing, and implement real-time previews. I’m also experimenting with features like image optimization, incremental static regeneration, and deployment workflows using platforms like Vercel and Netlify.

One of the things I enjoy most about this stack is how it empowers both developers and content creators. Editors get an intuitive interface to manage content, while developers maintain control over the presentation and performance of the site.

Everything in this repository is part of my learning process—each project, component, or integration is a step toward mastering modern web development with a focus on flexibility, speed, and maintainability.

If you’re working on similar projects or just curious about headless CMS and static site integrations, feel free to explore, clone, or contribute. Feedback and collaboration are always welcome!

Thanks for stopping by—and happy building! 🚀🧱🌐
